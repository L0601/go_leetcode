 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4,5]'
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] is a digit
 * between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
 *
 * The triangular sum of nums is the value of the only element present in nums
 * after the following process terminates:
 *
 *
 * Let nums comprise of n elements. If n == 1, end the process. Otherwise,
 * create a new 0-indexed integer array newNums of length n - 1.
 * For each index i, where 0 <= i < n - 1, assign the value of newNums[i] as
 * (nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10, where % denotes modulo operator.
 * Replace the array nums with newNums.
 * Repeat the entire process starting from step 1.
 *
 *
 * Return the triangular sum of nums.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation:
 * The above diagram depicts the process from which we obtain the triangular
 * sum of the array.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [5]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation:
 * Since there is only one element in nums, the triangular sum is the value of
 * that element itself.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 9
